# ricloud-csharp: iCloud access made easy

This is the archive of the sample .NET / C# client for Reincubate's [iCloud API](https://www.reincubate.com/labs/icloud-api/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-csharp&utm_campaign=ricloud).

**Note that this client is only compatible with the v1 API which is no longer in operation, and does not support functionality related to the latest *ricloud* v3 API. If you are looking to implement a .NET / C# API client for newer versions of the *ricloud* API we would be happy to advise and contribute.**

> Refer to the comprehensive [iCloud API documentation](https://www.reincubate.com/contact/support/icloud-api/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-csharp&utm_campaign=ricloud) for a fuller picture of the API's capabilities, specifications, and benefits.

## Installation

Users with the NuGet Package Manager  can download and install this package using the following command:

```bash
nuget install ricloud
```

Or the package can be downloaded directly from the [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ricloud/).

The source code can be compiled in Visual Studio 2010 or 2015 (other versions may also work). The only third-party dependency is currently `Newtonsoft.JSON` which is available to download via NuGet or directly from [json.net](http://www.json.net).

### Configuration

The API relies on a set of security credentials. Sample credentials are baked into the `sample_application.cs` example file.

## Usage

A sample script is included which provides an example of how the API can be used to access a range of datatypes in a way that is compatible with Apple's 2FA mechanism. To use the sample script you will first need to compile the ricloud project. Once this is done, you can compile the `sample_application.cs` file with the following command line (ensure you either change the DLL reference paths or copy them from the output folder into the same folder as the sample script):

```
csc sample_application.cs /reference:ricloud.dll,Newtonsoft.JSON.dll
```

This will create a console application called '''sample_application.exe'''

Here's what the output from the sample script looks like:
